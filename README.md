# Introduction

**ClearClipboard** is a simple tool that will *periodically clear* your clipboard. This is useful, for example, to hide sensitive information, such as passwords. The clear timeout can be configured freely and defaults to 30 seconds. Also, the clipboard will *not* simply be cleared at a fixed interval. Instead, the clear timer will be *reset* every time that new content is copied to the clipboard. This ensures that only "stale" content will be cleared; recently copied content will *never* be cleared away.

*Note:* The ClearClipboard program runs "hidden" in the background. However, there will be an icon in the [notification area](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/winenv-notification), which can be used to control or terminate ClearClipboard. Only one instance of ClearClipboard can be running at a time.


# System requirements

ClearClipboard runs on Windows Vista or newer. The "x64" version requires a 64-Bit version of Windows Vista or newer.

Windows XP is **not** supported due to the lack of the `AddClipboardFormatListener` system function!

## Windows 10 Warning

Windows 10 contains some "problematic" features that can put a risk on sensitive information copied to the clipboard:

* The first of those features is called "Clipboard History", which will silently keep a history (copy) of *all* data that has been copied to clipboard at some time. This history will persist even after the clipboard has been cleared!

* The second feature is called "Automatic Syncing" (Cloud Clipboard), which will automatically upload *all* data that is copied to clipboard to the Microsoft cloud servers â€“ purportedly to synchronize the clipboard between your devices!

We ***highly*** recommend to *disable* both of these features in order to allow ClearClipboard to function as expected. You can easily do this in the "Windows Settings" on the "System/Clipboard" page. See [here](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/109799-turn-off-clipboard-history-windows-10-a.html) and [here](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/110048-enable-disable-clipboard-sync-across-devices-windows-10-a.html) for more information!


# Command-line Options

The ClearClipboard program supports the following *mutually exclusive* command-line options:

* **`--close`**  
  Close the running instance of ClearClipboard, if ClearClipboard is currently running. Does nothing, otherwise.

* **`--restart`**  
  Start a new instance of ClearClipboard. If ClearClipboard is already running, the running instance is closed.

* **`--install`**  
  Add "autorun" entry for ClearClipboard to the registry, so that ClearClipboard runs *automatically* at system startup.

* **`--uninstall`**  
  Remove the "autorun" entry for ClearClipboard from the registry, if it currently exists. Does nothing, otherwise.

In addition, one or more of the following options may be appended to the command-line:

* **`--silent`**  
  Suppress message boxes. Use, e.g., in combination with `--install` or `--uninstall` command.

* **`--debug`**  
  Enable debug outputs (verbose mode). You can use the [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) tool to show the generated debug messages.

* **`--slunk`**  
  Enable slunk mode for improved user experience. Check it out!


# Configuration File

The behavior of the ClearClipboard program can be adjusted via a configuration file, in the [INI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

The configuration file must be located in the same directory as the ClearClipboard executable. Also, it must have the same file name as the ClearClipboard executable, except that the file extension is replaced by **`.ini`**. The default configuration file name therefore is **`ClearClipboard.ini`**. All parameters need to be located in the **`[ClearClipboard]`** section.

The following configuration parameters are supported:

* **`Timeout=<msec>`**  
  Specifies the timeout for automatic clipboard clearing, in milliseconds. Default: `30000`.

* **`Sound=<0|1|2>`**  
  Controls sound effects. Mode `1` plays a sound, when the clipboard is cleared manually. Mode `2` additionally plays a sound every time that the clipboard is cleared automatically. And mode `0` disables all sounds. Default: `1`.

* **`Halted=<0|1>`**  
  If this parameter is set to `1`, ClearClipboard starts in "halted" mode, i.e. with automatic clearing paused. Default: `0`.

* **`DisableWarningMessages=<0|1>`**
  If this parameter is set to `1`, ClearClipboard will *not* warn about "problematic" Windows 10 features. Default: `0`.

## Example Configuration

An example configuration file:

	[ClearClipboard]
	Timeout=30000
	Sound=1
	Halted=0

## Sound File

ClearClipboard uses the "Empty Recycle Bin" system sound, as configured in the control panel (`control mmsys.cpl`). If that sound file is *not* found (or *not* configured), ClearClipboard will fall back to the "Asterisk" system sound.
